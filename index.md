# TERMS <img src="man/figures/logo.png" width="120" align="right" />

TERMS stands for **T**-matrix for **E**lectromagnetic **R**adiation with
**M**ultiple **S**catterers ‚Äî it is a Fortran program to simulate the
near-field and far-field optical properties of collections of particles.
TERMS solves rigorously the Maxwell equations via the superposition
*T*-matrix method, where incident and scattered fields are decomposed
into a basis of multipolar electric and magnetic spherical waves.

In a multiple-scattering problem the net field exciting a given particle
is composed of the incident field plus the scattering contribution from
neighbouring particles, restulting in a coupled system of equations to
be solved for the total fields. TERMS implements several algorithms to
describe the self-consistent electromagnetic interaction between
multiple scatterers, and from there compute optical properties such as
absorption, scattering, extinction, circular dichroism, as well as
near-field intensities and the local degree of optical chirality.

By describing the incident and scattered fields in a basis of spherical
waves the *T*-matrix framework lends itself to analytical formulas for
orientation-averaged quantities such as far-field cross-sections and
near-field intensities, greatly reducing the computational time needed
to simulate particles and systems of particles in random orientation.

### Features

The possible computations are divided into three main modes:

-   Far-field quantities (absorption, scattering, extinction, circular
    dichroism) for multiple wavelengths and angles of incidence, as well
    as orientation-averages
-   Near-field calculations for multiple wavelengths and incident
    angles, also computing the local degree of chirality, as well as
    orientation-averages
-   Stokes parameters and differential scattering cross-sections for
    multiple incidence or scattering angles

The computational cost scales with the size of the linear system,
proportional to the number of particles *N*<sub>p</sub>, and to the
square of the maximum multipolar order *N*<sub>max</sub>. On a typical
PC we may treat up to ‚ÄÑ‚àº‚ÄÑ500 particles with *N*<sub>max</sub>‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ1, and a
dimer with *N*<sub>max</sub> up to ‚ÄÑ‚àº‚ÄÑ60.

Notable features of TERMS include:

-   Incident plane waves along arbitrary directions, with linear or
    circular polarisation
-   Built-in calculation of individual *T*-matrices for coated spheres;
    import of general *T*-matrices from other programs
    (e.g.¬†[SMARTIES](https://www.victoria.ac.nz/scps/research/research-groups/raman-lab/numerical-tools/smarties))
-   Built-in dielectric functions for common materials such as Au, Ag,
    Al, Cr, Pt, Pd, Si, and Water, or from tabulated values
-   Per-layer absorption in layered spheres
-   Orientation-averaging of far-field cross-sections, as well as linear
    and circular dichroism
-   Near-field maps of electric and magnetic field components,

-   Calculation of the global cluster *T*-matrix
-   ‚ÄúMasking‚Äù of specific multipolar orders
-   Calculation of Stokes parameters, phase matrix, differential
    scattering
-   Plain text or HDF5 I/O format
-   Possible compilation in quad-precision

### System requirements

-   Fortran 90 compiler
-   Cmake
-   (optional) HDF5 library
-   (optional) LAPACK

The electromagnetic field is expanded in the basis of vector spherical
waves, with the Bessel/Hankel functions computed using
[TOMS644](http://www.netlib.org/toms-2014-06-10/644) library (source
included in **TERMS**). Determining the collective scattering amounts to
either solving or inverting a large linear system, which is done using
[LAPACK](http://www.netlib.org/lapack/). All the relevant LAPACK
routines are included in **TERMS**, but it is recommended to link with
your system installed BLAS/LAPACK at compilation stage, because it can
enable multi-threading during runtime.  
Results are output in plain text files, or, alternatively, in `HDF5`
data format, which requires suitable `hdf5` libraries to be available on
your system.

### Compilation

We recommend using the cross platform compilation tool
[cmake](https://cmake.org/), to resolve all dependencies for your
system. From within the `build/` directory, type

    > cmake ..
    > make

to produce the executable `terms`. Note: if Cmake doesn‚Äôt find hdf5 (or
another library path) by default, you may need to export it explicitly
beforehand. For example on MacOS, the following has proved useful:

    # brew install hdf5
    export HDF5_ROOT=/usr/local/Cellar/hdf5/1.12.0_3/

Alternatively, a minimal build script is available in the `build/`
directory; the program can be compiled by executing `bash buildTERMS.sh`
from a Linux terminal with [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/).
Edit ‚ÄòbuildTERMS.sh‚Äô to specify a compiler other than
[GFortran](https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortran).

#### Downloading the code

We recommend downloading the [latest release
here](https://github.com/nano-optics/terms/releases)
\[`terms_code_1.0.0(.zip|.tar)`\]. You can also browse/clone/fork the
[entire repository](https://github.com/nano-optics/terms), but note that
it contains many files used to generate the website, which are not
relevant for using TERMS.

### The input file

When running the stand-alone executable, main input parameters are read
from a plain text input file (line by line and from left to right). Each
line is interpreted as a sentence and split into space-separated words.
The first (left-most) word is interpreted as a keyword, and the
subsequent words as arguments for that keyword. In each sentence, text
from the first word starting with the hash character (`#`) is
interpreted as a human-readable comment and thus ignored by the program.
All the supported keywords and corresponding arguments are [documented
on this page](http://nano-optics.ac.nz/terms/articles/Keywords.html).
The order of keywords generally doesn‚Äôt matter, with just two
exceptions: `ModeAndScheme` must be the first keyword, and `Scatterers`
must be the last. Two examples of input files are provided in the
`/test` directory.
