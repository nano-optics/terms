@article{Glukhova:2023aa,
	abstract = {Plasmonic core-satellite nanostructures have recently attracted interest in photocatalytic applications. The core plasmonic nanoparticle acts like an antenna{,} funnelling incident light into the near-field region{,} where it excites the smaller satellite nanoparticles with resonantly enhanced absorption. Computer simulations of the optical absorption by such structures can prove challenging{,} even with state-of-the-art numerical methods{,} due to the large difference in size between core and satellite particles. We present a generalised coupled-dipole model that enables efficient computations of light absorption in such nanostructures{,} including those with many satellites. The method accurately predicts the local absorption in each satellite despite being two orders of magnitude weaker than the absorption in the core particle. We assess the range of applicability of this model by comparing the results against the superposition T-matrix method{,} a rigorous solution of Maxwell{'}s equations that is much more resource-intensive and becomes impractical as the number of satellite particles increases.},

@article{Schebarchov:2022wc,
	abstract = {We introduce terms, an open-source Fortran program to simulate near-field and far-field optical properties of clusters of particles. The program solves rigorously the Maxwell equations via the superposition T-matrix method, where incident and scattered fields are decomposed into series of vector spherical waves. terms implements several algorithms to solve the coupled system of multiple scattering equations that describes the electromagnetic interaction between neighbouring scatterers. From this formal solution, the program can compute a number of physically-relevant optical properties, such as far-field cross-sections for extinction, absorption, scattering and their corresponding circular dichroism, as well as local field intensities and degree of optical chirality. By describing the incident and scattered fields in a basis of spherical waves the T-matrix framework lends itself to analytical formulas for orientation-averaged quantities, corresponding to systems of particles in random orientation; terms offers such computations for both far-field and near-field quantities of interest. This user guide introduces the program, summarises the relevant theory, and is supplemented by a comprehensive suite of stand-alone examples in the website accompanying the code.},

@article{Fazel-Najafabadi:2022ud,
	abstract = {The optical properties of nanoparticle clusters vary with the spatial arrangement of the constituent particles{,} but also the overall orientation of the cluster with respect to the incident light. This is particularly important in the context of nanoscale chirality and associated chiroptical responses{,} such as circular dichroism or differential scattering of circularly polarised light in the far-field{,} or local degree of optical chirality in the near-field. We explore the angular dependence of such quantities for a few archetypal geometries: a dimer of gold nanorods{,} a helix of gold nanospheres{,} and a linear chain of silicon particles. The examples serve to illustrate the possible variation of chiroptical responses with the direction of light incidence{,} but also{,} consequently{,} the importance of a robust orientation-averaging procedure when modelling general clusters of particles in random orientation. Our results are obtained with the rigorous superposition T-matrix method{,} which provides exact analytical formulas for fixed and orientation-averaged properties.},
